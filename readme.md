# Lite Voice Terminal

Lite Voice Terminal is free and open source platform for powering up DIY "light" smart speaker offline solution for Russian language. “Lite” in this case mean voice terminal is built on very limited computational platform (like RaspberryPi Zero ) but works as a client to on-premise LVT server configured for offline voice recognition.

###LVT is based on:
* [kaldi speech recognition toolkit](https://github.com/alphacep/kaldi)
* [vosk API](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-ap)
* [pymorphy2, morphological analyzer for Russian and Ukrainian languages](https://github.com/kmike/pymorphy2)
* [RHVoice, speech synthesizer for Russian language](https://github.com/Olga-Yakovleva/RHVoice)
